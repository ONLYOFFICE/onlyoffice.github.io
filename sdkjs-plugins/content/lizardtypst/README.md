# LizardTypst Plugin

A simple plugin for ONLYOFFICE that allows you to insert Typst mathematical formulas as high-quality SVG images, powered by the `typst.ts` library.

This plugin is compatible with [self-hosted](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer) and [desktop](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors) versions of ONLYOFFICE editors. It can be added to ONLYOFFICE instances manually.

## Features

- **Real-time Preview**: See a live preview of the rendered Typst formula as you type.
- **SVG-based Rendering**: Inserts formulas as scalable vector graphics, ensuring high quality at any zoom level.

## Powered By

This plugin leverages the power of [typst.ts](https://github.com/myriaddreamin/typst.ts), a powerful TypeScript library for compiling and rendering Typst code directly in the browser using WebAssembly.

## How to use

1. Go to the **Plugins** tab in the ONLYOFFICE editor.
2. Click on the **LizardTypst** icon to open the plugin window.
3. Enter your Typst code in the input area on the left. A preview will be generated on the right.
4. Once you are satisfied with the result, click the **Insert** button to place the image into your document.

## How to install
